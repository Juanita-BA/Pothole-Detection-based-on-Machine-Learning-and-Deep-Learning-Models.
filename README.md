# Pothole-Detection-based-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Models.
Pothole detection using machine learning and deep learning models involves the use of advanced algorithms to identify road surface irregularities in real time.
These models typically analyze data from various sources like cameras, sensors, or accelerometers mounted on vehicles to detect and classify potholes. Machine learning approaches rely on labeled data sets to train models, while deep learning, particularly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can automatically extract features from images or sensor data, improving detection accuracy without the need for manual feature engineering.

By utilizing these models, cities and municipalities can proactively identify potholes, leading to timely repairs and enhanced road safety. This approach reduces manual inspection costs and provides more accurate and consistent detection, ultimately improving transportation infrastructure maintenance.
